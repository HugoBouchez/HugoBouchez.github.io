**Explaination:**
This dashboard is designed for comparing performance across different Business Units (BUs). Filters allow selection of specific data by BU and contract status. Bar charts represent turnover, costs, and profits per BU, facilitating performance evaluation. Additional graphs show days off, sick leave, and out-of-scope work days, as well as project participation percentage, providing detailed comparative analysis of HR management practices.

**Explaination:**

The line graphs provide a dynamic view of monthly trends in budgets versus actuals, enabling quick analysis of discrepancies. Monthly filters facilitate detailed data exploration. Bar graphs for TJME and daily costs offer a visual comparison of financial performance across different types of workers. Detailed tables comparing budget to actual figures provide in-depth analysis of variances, with color highlighting significant deviations. This layout optimizes readability and clarity of information, offering a rapid and precise understanding of the company's financial and operational performance.

# Visual Analysis of Film Data

**Introduction:** This project involved the analysis and visualization of film data extracted from IMDb and Allociné. Visualization played a crucial role in making cinematic trends accessible and understandable.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Web scraping techniques were used to gather detailed information about films, including titles, release years, genres, directors, and actors, from various online sources.

**Visual Analysis:** Matplotlib library was utilized to create informative visualizations:
- **Film Distribution by Genre:** A bar chart depicted the number of films in each genre, with an overlay of average ratings represented by red dots, providing a detailed view of the most frequent and highest-rated genres.
- **Global Genre Distribution:** A pie chart presented the overall distribution of films by genre in percentage, offering a visual perspective of genre distribution within IMDb's top 250.
- **Average Ratings Evolution by Decade:** A line graph showcased how the average rating of films changes across decades, offering an insight into rating trends over time.
- **Director Performance:** A bar chart highlighted the number of films directed by the most prolific directors, visually indicating their performance in terms of average ratings.

**Conclusion:** Visualizing the data extracted significant insights into cinematic trends, highlighting dominant genres, the evolution of average ratings over the years, and director performances within IMDb's top 250.

**Impact and Acquired Skills:** This experience strengthened my ability to transform raw data into clear and informative visualizations, showcasing proficiency in visual analysis tools to present relevant insights from complex data.

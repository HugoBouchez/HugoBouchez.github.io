### Olist Project: Vendor Analysis and Impact on Review Scores

This in-depth study of Olist vendors hinges on a multi-criteria analysis, incorporating metrics such as delivery times, order volumes, and geographical locations. By cross-referencing this data, our goal was to uncover the correlations between these parameters and the review scores of vendors.

The dashboard serves as the visual centerpiece of our analysis. It provides a graphical synthesis of the key findings we've unearthed. For instance, it highlights how delivery times directly impact review scores. Additionally, it illuminates geographical regions where vendors face challenges and identifies products that potentially cause customer satisfaction issues. This interactive interface not only showcases these trends but also allows for deeper data exploration to better understand observed patterns.

**Conclusion:**

This comprehensive analysis sheds light on several critical factors influencing vendor review scores on Olist. We observed that delivery time stands out as a pivotal element: early deliveries tend to garner more positive evaluations. Moreover, order volume appears to affect review quality, indicating the need to encourage vendors to maintain high review scores despite handling a high number of transactions. Finally, the analysis of product categories sold reveals trends that could influence review scores, notably with products like computer accessories, which might be associated with quality or delivery issues.

These insights offer strategic pathways to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize sales practices on the Olist platform. By focusing on shorter delivery times, managing order volumes, and carefully evaluating categories of products sold, it's possible to bolster vendors' reputations and increase overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The project involves collaborating with a bank to clean and reformat data from a recent marketing campaign promoting personal loans. The provided CSV file, **"bank_marketing.csv,"** needs to be processed and split into three separate CSV files: **client.csv**, **campaign.csv**, and **economics.csv**. Each file must adhere to specific data structures and types for easy integration into a PostgreSQL database for future campaigns. Tasks include renaming columns, managing missing values, and converting data types according to the given specifications.

## Script Summary

This script cleans and splits the bank's marketing data into three CSV files (**client.csv**, **campaign.csv**, **economics.csv**) using **pandas** and **numpy**. It standardizes the data by fixing formatting issues, converting columns to appropriate types (e.g., boolean, datetime), and removing unnecessary columns. The result is a clean, structured dataset ready for database integration.
